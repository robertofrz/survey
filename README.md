This was my first ever project while learning HTML and CSS! It's a survey to colect data and help other students to improve their learning methods. It took me a long time as I had barely any experience with HTML and CSS but I liked it. My favorite part was learning to work with form and input elements. I feel like the CSS could look way better, but as my first project, I felt satisfied. BTW, the feeling of completing my first project was amazing and it got me excited for evertyhting that comes in my way!!
